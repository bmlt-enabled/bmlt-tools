DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT, hereafter) is a very powerful client/server system
that has been written for a very specific purpose, for a very specific clientele.

It is designed to track and locate Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which are regularly-
scheduled weekly, recurring events.

The intended clientele is Narcotics Anonymous Service bodies. They implement a BMLT
server, and provide the server to other NA Service bodies.

You can find out way too much about the BMLT here: http://bmlt.magshare.net

You can follow us on Twitter for release announcements: http://twitter.com/BMLT_NA

This is a set of scripts and tools that we make available for messing with the BMLT.

CAVEAT EMPTOR. These scripts are dangerous, which is exactly why we don't release them
as general use scripts.
